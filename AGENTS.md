# Agent Resources

All agent-facing documentation lives in the `Internal/` folder.

- Start with `Internal/AGENTS_GUIDE.md` for orientation, workflows, and expectations.
- Additional specs and phase guides are in `Internal/` alongside the agent guide.

Keep this file pinned so you can quickly jump into the Internal docs when needed.
